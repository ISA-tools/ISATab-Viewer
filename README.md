Shark-Kahuna
============

Project Shark Kahuna is a file viewer for ISA-Tab. Gone are the days of only using ISAcreator.

If you put your ISA files on github as gists, you just need to supply the gist id and call this function.

###Examples

#### Render from a Gist

```
	ISATabViewer.rendering.render_isatab_from_gist('2c606f6be7fc59ff196c', '#investigation_file');
```
