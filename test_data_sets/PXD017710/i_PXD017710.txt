Study Identifier	"PXD017710"
Study Title	"SARS-CoV-2 infected host cell proteomics reveal potential therapy targets"
Study Description	"A novel coronavirus was recently discovered and termed SARS-CoV-2. Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), for which, at this point, over 80,000 cases resulting in over 2,500 deaths have been reported in over 40 countries. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by SARS-CoV-19 infection and reveal that drugs targeting pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the SARS-CoV-2 infection profile by translatome and proteome proteomics at different times after infection."

Study Protocol Description	"Human Caco-2 cells, derived from colon carcinoma, was obtained from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ; Braunschweig, Germany). Cells were grown at 37C in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and containing 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. All culture reagents were purchased from Sigma."	"Samples were prepared as previously described. Briefly, proteins were precipitated using methanol/chloroform precipitation and resuspended in 8 M Urea/10 mM EPPS pH 8.2."	"Isolated proteins were digested with 1:50 wt/wt LysC (Wako Chemicals) and 1:100 wt/wt Trypsin (Promega, Sequencing grade) overnight at 37C after dilution to a final Urea concentration of 1 M. Then, digests were acidified (to pH 2-3) using TFA. Peptides were purified using C18 (50 mg) SepPak columns (Waters) as previously described. Desalted peptides were dried and 25 ug of peptides were resuspended in TMT labelling buffer (200 mM EPPS pH 8.2, 10% acetonitrile). Peptides were subjected to TMT labelling with 1:2 Peptide TMT ratio (wt/wt) for one hour at room temperature. Labelling reaction was quenched by addition of hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.5% and incubation at room temperature for additional 15 min. Labelled peptides were pooled and subjected to High pH Reverse Phase fractionation with the HpH RP Fractionation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions. All multiplexes were mixed with a bridge channel, that consists of control sample labelled in one reaction and split to all multiplexes in equimolar amounts."	"Peptides were resuspended in 0.1% FA and separated on an Easy nLC 1200 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and a 22 cm long, 75 µm ID fused-silica column, which had been packed in house with 1.9 um C18 particles (ReproSil-Pur, Dr. Maisch), and kept at 45C using an integrated column oven (Sonation). Peptides were eluted by a non-linear gradient from 5–38% acetonitrile over 120 min and directly sprayed into a QExactive HF mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoFlex ion source (ThermoFisher Scientific) at a spray voltage of 2.3 kV. Full scan MS spectra (350-1400 m/z) were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200, a maximum injection time of 100 ms and an AGC target value of 3 x 106. Up to 20 most intense peptides per full scan were isolated using a 1 Th window and fragmented using higher energy collisional dissociation (normalized collision energy of 35). MS/MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 45,000 at m/z 200, a maximum injection time of 80 ms and an AGC target value of 1 x 105. Ions with charge states of 1 and > 6 as well as ions with unassigned charge states were not considered for fragmentation. Dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s to minimize repeated sequencing of already acquired precursors."	"Raw files were analysed using Proteome Discoverer (PD) 2.4 software (ThermoFisher Scientific). Spectra were selected using default settings and database searches performed using SequestHT node in PD. Database searches were performed against trypsin digested Homo Sapiens SwissProt database, SARS-CoV-2 database (Uniprot pre-release) and FASTA files of common contaminants (contaminants.fasta provided with MaxQuant) for quality control. Fixed modifications were set as TMT6 at the N-terminus and carbamidomethyl at cysteine residues. One search node was set up to search with TMT6 (K) and methionine oxidation as static modifications to search for light peptides and one search node was set up with TMT6+K8 (K, +237.177), Arg10 (R, +10.008) and methionine oxidation as static modifications to identify heavy peptides. Searches were performed using Sequest HT. After search, posterior error probabilities were calculated and PSMs filtered using Percolator using default settings. Consensus Workflow for reporter ion quantification was performed with default settings, except the minimal signal-to-noise ratio was set to 5. Results were then exported to Excel files for further processing. For proteome quantification all PSMs were summed intensity normalized, followed by IRS30 and TMM31 normalization and peptides corresponding to a given UniProt Accession were summed including all modification states. For translatome measurements excel files were used as input for a custom made in-house Python pipeline. Python 3.6 was used together with the following packages: pandas 0.23.432, numpy 1.15.433, scipy 1.3.0. Excel files with normalized PSM data were read in and each channel was normalized to the lowest channel based on total intensity. For each peptide sequence, all possible modification states containing a heavy label were extracted and the intensities for each channel were averaged between all modified peptides. Baseline subtraction was performed by subtracting the measured intensities for the non-SILAC labelled sample from all other values. Negative intensities were treated as zero. The heavy label incorporation at the protein level was calculated by summing the intensities of all peptide sequences belonging to one unique protein accession. These values were combined with the standard protein output of PD 2.4 to add annotation data to the master protein accessions."
